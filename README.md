# UOL-Trading-Platform
This crypto-trading platform code follows the Object Oriented Programming Specialization course on Coursera by University of London. 
I didn't complete the course for the certification but to help me refresh my proficiency in C++ while deepening my understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. I aimed to apply these principles in a practical, real-world project, ensuring a strong grasp of how OOP is used effectively in software development.
